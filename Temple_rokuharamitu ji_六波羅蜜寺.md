## Temple Rokuharamitsu ji

#####

---

This temple of the Shingon sect of Japanese Buddhism was founded by the monk Kuya in 951 to embody prayers for recovery from an epidemic. The temple's main image, the Juichimen kannon (a National Treasure), is said to have been carved by Kuya himself.

The second son of the emperor Daigo, Kuya became a Buddhist monk at a young age and is known for his practice of repeating the name of the Buddha while dancing for joy.

Endowed with an expansive domain in the past, the temple occupies a central place among historical sites marking the events of the rise and decline of the Minamoto and Taira clans; it was the site of the Taira clan's palace and accommodated local representative of the Kamakura government known as a tandai. Among the treasures housed in Rokuharamitsuji's Homotsukan are numerous Important Cultural Properties, including the Jizo Bodhisattva, said to be the work of the sculptor Jocho; a statue of the monk Kuya; and a seated statue of Taira-no-Kiyomori.

Famous events and festivals held at the temple every year include Obukucha (January 1 to 3), Mantoe (August), and the Kuya Dancing Nembutsu, a nationally designated Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property known as the "Hidden Nembutsu" (December).
